            <li>I used to be a computer science major. Hoping to get a more design focused perspective on web making and build something for my portfolio.</li>
            <li>Yes, I have experience in html, css, and JS. I've also used React before too. Never taken an official class on them; mostly just for fun.</li>
            <li>I hope to learn the design perspective of websites as opposed to just the code side</li>
            <li>Designing for screens is different than paper because everyone has a different size screen</li>
            <li>I think <a href="https://www.google.com/">google.com</a> has great design because it is simple and too the point.</li>
            <li>I think <a href="https://www.netflix.com">netflix.com</a> works well. It puts a lot of content on your screen but it is still easy to comprehend and manage.</li>
