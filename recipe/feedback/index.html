    <p>Personal feedback: I want to make the webpage as a whole more cohesive. Design wise it feels like a nunch of parts that don't fit together. I'm thinking of maybe implementing some API with an interactive book</p>
    <p>make it more clear you can click the checkboxes</p>
    <p>have color change when hovored over</p>
    <p>first part has nothing to do with the rest of the page or chicken</p>
    <p>put full recipe name</p>
    <p>typeface is hard to read</p>
    checkboxed would look better aligne with first line of text
    communication needs to be at the forfront of design
    Once you have a new plan start over. Don't get stuck on what you previously had
