        <h1>Don't Be Scared</h1>
        <h2>By Sophie Meiers</h2>
    <p>
        <br>
        You set yourself apart from the rest<br>
        You're like the nervousness in my chest<br>
        You're the way I lose my breath<br>
        You're the one who's there when there's nothing left<br>
        You set yourself apart from the rest<br>
        You're like the nervousness in my chest<br>
        You're the way I lose my breath<br>
        You're the one who's there when there's no one left<br>
        <br>
        Come a little closer, don't be scared<br>
        I want you smiling back at me, hands in my hair<br>
        Come a little closer, baby why don't ya<br>
        Come a little closer<br>
        Come a little closer, don't be scared<br>
        I want you smiling back at me, hands in my hair<br>
        Come a little closer, baby why don't ya<br>
        Come a little closer<br>
        <br>
        You're a common character in my dreams<br>
        I wish that you could maybe see that<br>
        You are sewn into my memories<br>
        Every word that I sing<br>
        Can you hear it in the melody?<br>
        I wish that you would open up to me<br>
        Can you hear it in the melody?<br>
        I wish that you would open up to me<br>
        <br>
        Come a little closer, don't be scared<br>
        I want you smiling back at me, hands in my hair<br>
        Come a little closer, baby why don't ya<br>
        Come a little closer<br>
        Come a little closer, don't be scared<br>
        I want you smiling back at me, hands in my hair<br>
        Come a little closer, baby why don't ya<br>
        Come a little closer<br>
        <br>
        You set yourself, apart, apart, from the rest<br>
        You're like the, nervousness, in my, in my, in my chest<br>
        In my chest<br>
